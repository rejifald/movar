Pipe-join Google's `lr` parameter across every preferred language. A user whose priority is `[uk, en]` now ends up with `lr=lang_uk|lang_en` on `/search`, so results can come from either language. Previously only the top preference reached `lr`, which made English speakers with Ukrainian as their #1 lose every English result they'd otherwise expect.

`hl` continues to take the top preference only — it's the UI + AI Overview language, a "pick one" knob.

Adds an optional per-param `joinPreferences?: boolean` field to the `searchParams` strategy. The Google rule sets it on `lr`; `hl` keeps the existing single-value behaviour. Other rules (Bing `setlang`, DDG `kl`, YouTube `hl`/`gl`) are unchanged — none of them have a documented OR-join syntax.

`applyStrategy` now accepts `LanguageCode | readonly LanguageCode[]` as its target; single-value callers (tests, the hreflang fallback) keep working unchanged.

Policy assertion: the rewrite is driven only by the user's stored preferences (already `ru`-free via `enforceLockedLanguages`). Browser locale and inbound URL state — including a stale `hl=ru&lr=lang_ru` from a Google referrer — are overwritten, never inherited.
