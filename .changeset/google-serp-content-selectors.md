Make the Google SERP content filter actually hide Russian on the current layout, and extend it to "People also ask".

The extractor matched only `div.g` / `div[data-snhf]`, which hit zero nodes on today's Google markup — so Russian organic results and the "Схожі запитання" (People also ask) questions leaked through unfiltered. Organic results are now found by a layout-stable anchor (each `#rso` result `<h3>` climbed to its enclosing `data-hveid` card) instead of obfuscated styling classes (`div.tF2Cxc`, …) that rotate and silently stop matching. No rotating-class fallbacks are kept — a stale fallback is just a deferred silent-miss; the fix for an uncovered layout is another reliable anchor. People-also-ask questions are filtered per row (`div.related-question-pair`), so a Russian question is hidden while a Ukrainian one in the same block stays. Nested result cards (sitelinks) collapse to the outermost container so a result is never hidden twice.

The content filter now also runs on any `google.*` ccTLD (matched structurally on the SERP shape), not just a fixed seven-domain allowlist.
