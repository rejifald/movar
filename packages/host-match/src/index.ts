/**
 * Host predicates shared by the redirect layer and the page-content extractors.
 *
 * "Is this host site X" has to agree across three places: the extension's
 * redirect rules (`apps/extension/src/sites/`), the capability resolver, and the
 * page-content extractors' `matches()`. Keeping the predicates here — a tiny,
 * dependency-free package — lets the pure model packages (consumed by
 * `apps/diagnostics` too) share them without importing extension code. The
 * redirect rules themselves are co-located with each site adapter.

/**
 * Public suffixes Google operates a search frontend on, as exact dot-joined
 * trailing-label strings. Anchoring `isGoogleHost` to this curated set (rather
 * than a "1–2 trailing labels" length check) is what rejects spoof hosts such
 * as `google.evil.com` / `a.google.b`: the registrable `google` label must be
 * immediately followed by a *recognised* public suffix, and `evil.com` / `b`
 * are not in it.
 *
 * The set lists both the single-label TLDs (gTLD `com`; ccTLDs `de`, `es`, …)
 * and the multi-label public suffixes (`co.uk`, `com.ua`, …) Google uses. A
 * single-label trailing label is NOT accepted generically — that is exactly the
 * hole that let `a.google.b` through — so a real ccTLD apex must appear here.
 *
 * Dependency-free tradeoff (vs. pulling in the Public Suffix List / `tldts`):
 * the package's zero-dep invariant is preserved, but a brand-new Google ccTLD
 * shape needs an entry added here. The list is derived from Google's published
 * domain set; it is intentionally broad so a genuine ccTLD is never dropped.
 *
 * Space-separated packed strings, not an array literal, on purpose: this module
 * rides in the size-budgeted content script injected into every page, and the
 * array form spends 3 extra bytes per entry (quotes + comma) — ~370 bytes across
 * the 182 entries. Entries stay greppable (`com.ua` matches verbatim). The
 * `@__PURE__` annotations (on the constructor AND the `.split` argument — both
 * must be provably droppable) keep the initializer tree-shakeable in bundles
 * that never call `isGoogleHost`.
